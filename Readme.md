Hello internet! This is Terrabot, my discord bot I decided to make a long time ago. Over time, this project has been constantly updated (and still is!!) and has evolved into what it is now. Please: Give it a try, and see what Terrabot has to offer.

***NOTE SOME OF THESE COMMANDS ARE IDEAS FROM FRIENDS/OTHER BOT DEVELOPERS. I AM NOT STEALING, I HAVE PERMISSION TO USE THEIR IDEAS.***<br>
-Over 150 commands!<br>
-Moderation commands for rulebreakers<br>
-Fun commands<br>
-And much more!<br>

Example config file:<br>
insults = ["put", "insults", "here"]<br>
max_nsfw_count = 75<br>
command_prefixes = ('^', "t%", 't&')<br>
owner_id = botownerid<br>
dev_ids = [trusted user ids]<br>
Lock_Status = 'no'<br>
lock_status = Lock_Status<br>
supporter_ids = [whatever user id u want]<br>
