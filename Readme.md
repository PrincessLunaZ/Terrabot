Hello internet! This is Terrabot, my discord bot I decided to make a long time ago. Over time, this project has been constantly updated (and still is!!) and has evolved into what it is now. Please: Give it a try, and see what Terrabot has to offer.

***NOTE SOME OF THESE COMMANDS ARE IDEAS FROM FRIENDS/OTHER BOT DEVELOPERS. I AM NOT STEALING, I HAVE PERMISSION TO USE THEIR IDEAS.***
-Over 150 commands!
-Moderation commands for rulebreakers
-Fun commands
-And much more!

Example config file:
`insults = ["put", "insults", "here"]__
max_nsfw_count = 7__
command_prefixes = ('^', "t%", 't&')__
owner_id = botownerid__
dev_ids = [trusted user ids]__
Lock_Status = 'no'__
lock_status = Lock_Status__
supporter_ids = [whatever user id u want]__
connection_url = "mongodbconnectionurl"__
`
